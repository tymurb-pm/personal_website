    <article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
        <p>Have you ever wondered why companies initiate projects? Maybe you've heard the saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you want something not to get done, call it a project.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a joke, of course, but it didn't appear out of nowhere. I've often encountered situations where people and companies don't understand why they need project managers or what's so valuable about project work. The idea for this essay came from <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanizex/">Mykola Kalakutskyi</a></strong>. The infamous story of Kodak, which lost its market due to ignoring the importance of innovative projects, perfectly illustrates this issue. So, why do companies actually launch projects?</p>
<p>To understand why companies need projects, it's worth clarifying some terms. Every <strong>project has two key characteristics</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It has a beginning and an end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It results in something new and unique.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <strong>building a new ship is a project</strong>. Launching a marketing campaign for a new product is also a project. Writing new procedures for company operations—again, a project. These activities have clear beginnings, ends, and unique outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>What is the opposite of projects? Operations.</strong> Operations are continuous, repetitive activities without a definite end. For instance, when I worked as a deck officer onboard a ship, our daily tasks were operational—we transported cargo continuously, without interruption. Operations are important, but they quickly become monotonous because they're an endless cycle.</p>
<p>This is exactly why <strong>companies launch projects—to move forward</strong>. Projects create something new, drive change within the company, and secure its future. They are ways to explore new opportunities and adapt to market shifts. Operations, meanwhile, provide stable income that finances projects.</p>
<p><strong>Consider Kodak</strong>: for a long time, Kodak was the global leader in photographic film and cameras. However, when digital photography emerged, Kodak <strong>overly focused on its ongoing operations</strong>—film production. Kodak's leadership didn’t launch substantial projects to develop digital technologies, failing to see the urgency. They overly trusted the stability of their operations and missed the opportunity to lead the digital market. By the time Kodak finally realized the necessity of change, it was already too late. <strong>Kodak lost most of its market share</strong> and eventually went bankrupt.</p>
<p>Today, with technology evolving at incredible speeds (especially due to artificial intelligence), launching projects has become much easier. Tasks that previously required entire teams can now be handled by a single individual. However, this creates a new challenge—the risk of chaos. This is where the role of a project manager becomes crucial. Project managers help clearly define goals, evaluate the potential of ideas, and manage priorities effectively.</p>
<p>From my own experience onboard ships, <strong>projects provided the greatest sense of purpose</strong>. Whether it was completely updating documentation or overhauling ventilation systems, these projects brought motivation and satisfaction. In such moments, you feel you're doing something meaningful and valuable.</p>
<p>In summary, <strong>companies launch projects to grow, respond to changes, and maintain their competitive edge</strong>. Often, people don't fully grasp why they need projects or why they should learn project management. But properly organized projects are vital tools for business survival and success in the modern world. So, if you want not just to sustain but also to develop your business, <strong>you simply can’t avoid projects</strong>. Initiate projects—they are the driving force that moves your company forward.</p>
