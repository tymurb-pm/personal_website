    <article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
        <p>Many of us have experienced teams that operate seamlessly from the very start: tasks are executed smoothly, mutual respect feels natural, and deadlines cause no panic.</p>
<p>Yet, there are countless other teams where tension, misunderstandings, and ongoing conflicts are prevalent. Often, these issues aren't due to an unwillingness to cooperate but stem from a lack of clarity, trust, or shared goals established at the outset.</p>
<p>This is where team development models can help by offering a roadmap that explains how people collaborate, communicate, and evolve together over time.</p>
<h2>Classic Starting Point: Tuckman’s Model</h2>
<p>If you’ve heard of any team development theory, it's likely Tuckman's Model, which outlines five stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Forming</strong> – Team members get acquainted; roles are unclear, and everyone is cautious.</li>
<li><strong>Storming</strong> – Conflicts arise as personalities and ideas clash; tensions escalate.</li>
<li><strong>Norming</strong> – The group starts resolving conflicts, agreeing on norms, and building cooperation.</li>
<li><strong>Performing</strong> – The team works harmoniously, focusing on shared goals with high productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Adjourning</strong> – The team completes tasks and either disbands or moves to new challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuckman's model is an excellent introduction to group dynamics, emphasizing that conflict (Storming) is a normal part of team growth.</p>
<p>However, Tuckman's sequence might seem too linear for today's dynamic work environments. Modern teams don't form just once; members come and go, objectives shift, and market conditions can change overnight. This step-by-step process doesn't always reflect real-life complexities. Additionally, crucial elements like trust and emotional safety, identified in studies such as Google's Project Aristotle, aren't explicitly highlighted in Tuckman’s stages.</p>
<h2>The Drexler-Sibbet Model</h2>
<p>The Drexler-Sibbet model expands upon Tuckman by emphasizing emotional and interpersonal factors that facilitate or hinder team success. It proposes seven stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Orientation</strong> – &quot;Why are we here? What's the big picture?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Trust Building</strong> – &quot;Can I rely on you, and can you rely on me?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Goal Clarification</strong> – &quot;What exactly are we trying to achieve?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong> – &quot;How do we make decisions, and what are our roles?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong> – &quot;Let’s get working: who does what, and how do we track progress?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>High Performance</strong> – &quot;We’re performing at our best. How do we sustain momentum?&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Renewal</strong> – &quot;What have we learned, and where do we go next?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>This model goes beyond Tuckman by placing trust and renewal front and center. Rather than viewing &quot;Implementation&quot; as the end, Drexler-Sibbet emphasizes that teams often revisit previous stages, particularly when new members join or the project shifts.</p>
<h2>Three Key Advantages of Drexler-Sibbet</h2>
<h3>1. Explicit Focus on Trust and Emotional Dynamics</h3>
<p>Google’s Project Aristotle (2017) identified psychological safety (trust) as the critical factor for high-performing teams. The Drexler-Sibbet model dedicates an entire stage to trust-building, whereas Tuckman addresses this indirectly.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Imagine a project team possessing all necessary skills but failing to collaborate effectively. Investigation revealed team members doubted each other’s abilities. Once they openly addressed these concerns and clarified individual strengths, productivity significantly improved. Trust cannot be bypassed when aiming for smooth collaboration.</p>
<h3>2. Continuous Renewal and Adaptation</h3>
<p>A major drawback of Tuckman’s model is its presumed linearity. Today's teams evolve cyclically; they might &quot;norm&quot; on Monday but face &quot;storming&quot; again by Wednesday due to market shifts or changes in the development roadmap.</p>
<p>The &quot;Renewal&quot; stage in Drexler-Sibbet explicitly encourages regular reassessment, aligning with the reality that no team’s journey is ever truly finished.</p>
<p>Renowned management consultant Peter Drucker said, &quot;The greatest danger in times of turbulence is acting with yesterday’s logic.&quot; The Renewal stage ensures you avoid complacency.</p>
<h3>3. Practical Tools for Facilitators</h3>
<p>The Drexler-Sibbet model offers visual tools like the &quot;Team Performance Model Chart,&quot; helping teams navigate conflicts, clarify objectives, and maintain productivity.</p>
<p>While Tuckman’s model is informative, it lacks these practical tools. Workshops might mention &quot;Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing&quot; but seldom provide guidance when conflicts recur. Drexler-Sibbet’s visualizations and targeted questions simplify problem identification and resolution.</p>
<h2>Using Drexler-Sibbet Alongside or Instead of Tuckman</h2>
<p>If you appreciate Tuckman's simplicity, consider Drexler-Sibbet as an extension. Begin with Tuckman for an overview, then utilize Drexler-Sibbet to focus on trust, roles, and continuous reassessment as your team evolves.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>It’s easy to assume that team spirit will naturally emerge when smart, motivated people come together. Reality often proves otherwise: teams frequently struggle without trust and clear goals.</p>
<p>Next time you notice a dip in morale or productivity, remember the problem might not be &quot;a lack of skills.&quot; Your team might have skipped vital stages essential for true synergy.</p>
<p>To ensure your team doesn't merely survive but thrives through collaboration and adaptability, consider embracing the Drexler-Sibbet model. It will help build a solid foundation of trust, efficiency, and continuous growth.</p>
