The Amazon founder is famous for dedicating the first hours of the day to … puttering? Bezos’s no-screen morning routine Back in 2018, Bezos laid out his usual morning routine in a speech at the Economic Club of Washington. It includes reading the paper, drinking coffee, and having breakfast with his family. You know what his “puttering time” does not include? Looking at his phone. In a recent interview with People, Bezos’s fiancée, Lauren Sanchez, confirmed her partner remains committed to slow mornings, adding, “We don’t get on our phones. That’s one of the rules.” W"

            data-content="📌 Introduction In the world of Project Management, it is essential to distinguish between projects and operations. While both contribute to organizational success, they serve distinct purposes and follow different management approaches. This article explores the fundamental differences between projects and operations, highlighting their characteristics, objectives, and management techniques. 📖 Definition of Projects and Operations 🛠 What is a Project? A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has: A defined beginning and end 📅 Specific objectives 🎯 A budget 💰 Resources and constraints ⚙️ Example: Developing a new mobile app, constructing a building, or launching a marketing campaign. 🔄 What are Operations? Operations refer to ongoing, repetitive activities that ensure the continuous functioning of a business. They focus on: Sustaining business functions 🏢 Efficiency and process optimization ⚡ Minimizing costs 💸 Standard procedures 📋 Example: Manufacturing goods, processing payroll, or providing customer support. 📊 Key Differences Between Projects and Operations Feature Projects 🏗 Operations 🔄 Nature Temporary Ongoing Purpose Create a unique output Maintain business continuity Duration Has a defined start and end Continuous with no end date Management Approach Uses project management methodologies Uses process management methodologies Resources Temporary allocation Permanent allocation Risk Level Higher due to uncertainty Lower due to standardization Change Management Frequent changes Minimal changes Examples Software development, event planning IT support, HR services 🔍 Similarities Between Projects and Operations Despite their differences, projects and operations share some similarities: ✔ Both require planning, execution, and monitoring 📊 ✔ Both utilize resources like time, budget, and personnel ⏳💰👥 ✔ Both contribute to organizational goals and strategy 🎯 ✔ Both require risk management and quality control ⚠️✅ 📈 How Project Management and Operations Management Interact Operations support projects by providing necessary resources. Projects improve operations through innovation and process enhancement. Operations can become projects when significant changes are required (e.g., system upgrades, process automation). &amp;quot;A well-managed project can lead to operational efficiency, and efficient operations can create opportunities for new projects.&amp;quot; 📌 Conclusion Understanding the differences between projects and operations is crucial for effective project management. While projects focus on innovation and change, operations ensure stability and efficiency. Organizations must balance both to remain competitive and sustainable. 💡 Key Takeaway: Projects bring transformation, and operations maintain consistency. Mastering both ensures business success! 🚀 📚 Further Reading 📖 PMBOK Guide – Project Management Institute (PMI) 📘 The Lean Startup – Eric Ries 📰 Agile vs Waterfall: Choosing the Right Approach 🔗 References Project Management Institute.
