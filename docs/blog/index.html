    data-title="Why Do We Need Projects at All?" 
    data-content="Have you ever wondered why companies initiate projects? Maybe you&#39;ve heard the saying: &amp;quot;If you want something not to get done, call it a project.&amp;quot; It&#39;s a joke, of course, but it didn&#39;t appear out of nowhere. I&#39;ve often encountered situations where people and companies don&#39;t understand why they need project managers or what&#39;s so valuable about project work. The idea for this essay came from Mykola Kalakutskyi. The infamous story of Kodak, which lost its market due to ignoring the importance of innovative projects, perfectly illustrates this issue. So, why do companies actually launch projects? To understand why companies need projects, it&#39;s worth clarifying some terms. Every project has two key characteristics: It has a beginning and an end. It results in something new and unique. For example, building a new ship is a project. Launching a marketing campaign for a new product is also a project. Writing new procedures for company operations—again, a project. These activities have clear beginnings, ends, and unique outcomes. What is the opposite of projects? Operations. Operations are continuous, repetitive activities without a definite end. For instance, when I worked as a deck officer onboard a ship, our daily tasks were operational—we transported cargo continuously, without interruption. Operations are important, but they quickly become monotonous because they&#39;re an endless cycle. This is exactly why companies launch projects—to move forward. Projects create something new, drive change within the company, and secure its future. They are ways to explore new opportunities and adapt to market shifts. Operations, meanwhile, provide stable income that finances projects. Consider Kodak: for a long time, Kodak was the global leader in photographic film and cameras. However, when digital photography emerged, Kodak overly focused on its ongoing operations—film production. Kodak&#39;s leadership didn’t launch substantial projects to develop digital technologies, failing to see the urgency. They overly trusted the stability of their operations and missed the opportunity to lead the digital market. By the time Kodak finally realized the necessity of change, it was already too late. Kodak lost most of its market share and eventually went bankrupt. Today, with technology evolving at incredible speeds (especially due to artificial intelligence), launching projects has become much easier. Tasks that previously required entire teams can now be handled by a single individual. However, this creates a new challenge—the risk of chaos. This is where the role of a project manager becomes crucial. Project managers help clearly define goals, evaluate the potential of ideas, and manage priorities effectively. From my own experience onboard ships, projects provided the greatest sense of purpose. Whether it was completely updating documentation or overhauling ventilation systems, these projects brought motivation and satisfaction. In such moments, you feel you&#39;re doing something meaningful and valuable. In summary, companies launch projects to grow, respond to changes, and maintain their competitive edge. Often, people don&#39;t fully grasp why they need projects or why they should learn project management. But properly organized projects are vital tools for business survival and success in the modern world. So, if you want not just to sustain but also to develop your business, you simply can’t avoid projects. Initiate projects—they are the driving force that moves your company forward."

    data-title="Care as a Leader’s Core Virtue" 
    data-content="Managerial roles vary widely, as do their responsibilities. However, there&#39;s a common trait uniting all leaders: the responsibility to support and develop their subordinates. Often onboard ships, I&#39;ve heard officers complain about having to &amp;quot;babysit&amp;quot; grown men. In my opinion, this is a profound misunderstanding. Employees approach their leaders not only because they lack knowledge or experience but because they need support and recognition. Here are two real-life examples: During my first contract with Stolt Tankers, I was a cadet. Chris, a cheerful and hardworking sailor, suddenly became withdrawn and quiet. Over a day passed, and no officer asked about his condition; instead, they complained about his declining performance. After our watch, I decided to speak with him. It turned out his father had died two days earlier, and he still had two months left of his mandatory contract. He wanted to attend the funeral but was afraid to bring it up with our captain—a stern and indifferent man. I spoke to the officer I worked with, and together we helped Chris write an early leave request. The chief officer brought it to the captain, and in the next port, we managed to find a replacement. The company incurred some costs but gained a loyal employee in return. Another incident occurred during my last contract. Ethan, a sailor, had a reputation for being unreliable and lazy, and all the officers treated him accordingly. We shared evening watches, during which I learned the company had promised him a promotion two years ago but never fulfilled their commitment. This caused Ethan to lose trust and interest in his job. I spoke with the chief officer to find out why Ethan wasn&#39;t being promoted. After a detailed (and emotional) discussion, I decided to act. I began delegating more responsible tasks aligned with Ethan’s potential position. Despite his disappointment with the company, he worked efficiently and with enthusiasm. Thanks to his attentiveness, we avoided several significant issues. Eventually, the chief officer agreed to give Ethan a positive recommendation, and the captain formally requested the office approve Ethan’s promotion. Unfortunately, the company declined his promotion during that contract, suggesting he wait for the next one. Did the company eventually fulfill its promise? I don&#39;t know, but one conclusion is clear: poor employee performance isn&#39;t always due to laziness. Most often, internal factors are involved. In the first case, the problem was a crisis that demanded empathy. In the second, it was lost motivation that could have been restored. Conclusion: A good leader recognizes that discipline without empathy breaks the team, and empathy without discipline makes it ineffective. It is precisely the balance between these two forces that determines how well a team functions."

    data-title="Is There Life Beyond Tuckman?" 
    data-content="Many of us have experienced teams that function seamlessly from the outset: tasks are executed smoothly, mutual respect feels natural, and deadlines cause no panic. However, numerous other teams experience ongoing tension, misunderstandings, or conflicts. Often, this tension isn&#39;t due to an unwillingness to cooperate but rather stems from a lack of clarity, trust, or shared goals from the very beginning. This is where team development models come into play, providing us with a roadmap explaining how people collaborate, communicate, and evolve together over time. Classic Starting Point: Tuckman&#39;s Model If you&#39;ve heard of any team development theory, it&#39;s likely Tuckman’s Model, which outlines five stages: Forming – Team members get acquainted; roles are unclear, and everyone acts cautiously. Storming – Conflicts arise as personalities and opinions clash, increasing tension. Norming – The group begins resolving conflicts, establishing norms, and building cooperation. Performing – The team works cohesively, focusing on common goals and achieving high productivity. Adjourning – The team completes tasks and either disbands or moves to new challenges. Tuckman’s model serves as an excellent introduction to group dynamics, highlighting conflict (Storming) as a natural part of growth. Yet, Tuckman&#39;s sequence might seem overly linear for modern workplace challenges. Today’s teams are rarely static; people come and go, objectives shift, and market conditions can change overnight. This linear approach doesn&#39;t always match real-world complexities. Additionally, crucial elements like trust and emotional safety—highlighted by research such as Google&#39;s &amp;quot;Project Aristotle&amp;quot;—are not explicitly emphasized in Tuckman’s stages. Drexler-Sibbet Model The Drexler-Sibbet Model expands upon Tuckman’s framework, emphasizing emotional and interpersonal elements crucial to team success or failure. It consists of seven stages: Orientation – &amp;quot;Why are we here? What&#39;s the big picture?&amp;quot; Trust Building – &amp;quot;Can I rely on you, and can you rely on me?&amp;quot; Goal Clarification – &amp;quot;What exactly are we trying to achieve?&amp;quot; Commitment – &amp;quot;How do we make decisions, and what is each person’s role?&amp;quot; Implementation – &amp;quot;Let’s get working: who does what, and how do we track progress?&amp;quot; High Performance – &amp;quot;We’re excelling. How do we maintain this momentum?&amp;quot; Renewal – &amp;quot;What have we learned, and where do we go next?&amp;quot; This model notably prioritizes trust and renewal, suggesting that teams often revisit previous stages, particularly when new members join or project scopes change. Three Key Arguments in Favor of This Model 1. Explicit Focus on Trust and Emotional Dynamics According to Google’s &amp;quot;Project Aristotle&amp;quot; (2017), psychological safety (trust) is the primary determinant of a high-performing team. Drexler-Sibbet explicitly dedicates a stage to building trust, whereas Tuckman addresses it only indirectly. Example: Imagine a project team that, despite having all required skills, struggles to collaborate effectively. Later, it&#39;s discovered that half the team doubts the others&#39; abilities. Once the team discusses these concerns and clarifies individual strengths, productivity significantly improves. Trust is essential for smooth collaboration. 2. Continuous Renewal and Adaptation One main criticism of Tuckman’s model is its assumed linearity—from Forming to Storming to Norming—as if teams follow a straightforward path. Modern teams evolve cyclically; they might be &amp;quot;norming&amp;quot; on Monday and back to &amp;quot;storming&amp;quot; by Wednesday due to market shifts or changes in project roadmaps. The Renewal stage in Drexler-Sibbet emphasizes regular reassessment, reflecting the ongoing nature of team development. As management consultant Peter Drucker stated, &amp;quot;The greatest danger in times of turbulence is acting with yesterday’s logic.&amp;quot; The Renewal stage ensures teams avoid complacency. 3. Practical Tools for Facilitators The Drexler-Sibbet model includes visual tools and diagrams, such as the &amp;quot;Team Performance Model Chart,&amp;quot; aiding in monitoring each stage. This provides facilitators with a clear map for resolving conflicts, clarifying goals, and sustaining performance. While informative, Tuckman’s model lacks such comprehensive practical tools. Workshops frequently mention &amp;quot;Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing&amp;quot; but rarely provide guidance for recurrent conflicts. Drexler-Sibbet’s visualizations and structured questions simplify problem-solving. Using Drexler-Sibbet Alongside (or Instead of) Tuckman If you appreciate Tuckman’s simplicity, use the Drexler-Sibbet model as an extension. Begin with Tuckman’s overview and then focus on trust, roles, and reassessment with Drexler-Sibbet as your team evolves. Main Idea It’s tempting to assume that team spirit naturally arises when bringing together intelligent, motivated individuals. Reality often proves otherwise: teams struggle without trust and clear objectives. The next time morale or productivity dips, consider that the issue may not be a lack of skills. Perhaps your team hasn&#39;t navigated the necessary stages for achieving genuine synergy. To ensure your team doesn&#39;t just survive but thrives through collaboration and adaptability, embrace the Drexler-Sibbet model. It lays a strong foundation for trust, effectiveness, and growth."
