Managerial roles vary widely, as do their responsibilities. However, there's a common trait uniting all leaders: the responsibility to support and develop their subordinates.

Often onboard ships, I've heard officers complain about having to "babysit" grown men. In my opinion, this is a profound misunderstanding. Employees approach their leaders not only because they lack knowledge or experience but because they need support and recognition.

Here are two real-life examples:

1) During my first contract with Stolt Tankers, I was a cadet. Chris, a cheerful and hardworking sailor, suddenly became withdrawn and quiet. Over a day passed, and no officer asked about his condition; instead, they complained about his declining performance.

After our watch, I decided to speak with him. It turned out his father had died two days earlier, and he still had two months left of his mandatory contract. He wanted to attend the funeral but was afraid to bring it up with our captain—a stern and indifferent man.

I spoke to the officer I worked with, and together we helped Chris write an early leave request. The chief officer brought it to the captain, and in the next port, we managed to find a replacement. The company incurred some costs but gained a loyal employee in return.

2) Another incident occurred during my last contract. Ethan, a sailor, had a reputation for being unreliable and lazy, and all the officers treated him accordingly. We shared evening watches, during which I learned the company had promised him a promotion two years ago but never fulfilled their commitment. This caused Ethan to lose trust and interest in his job.

I spoke with the chief officer to find out why Ethan wasn't being promoted. After a detailed (and emotional) discussion, I decided to act. I began delegating more responsible tasks aligned with Ethan’s potential position. Despite his disappointment with the company, he worked efficiently and with enthusiasm. Thanks to his attentiveness, we avoided several significant issues. Eventually, the chief officer agreed to give Ethan a positive recommendation, and the captain formally requested the office approve Ethan’s promotion. Unfortunately, the company declined his promotion during that contract, suggesting he wait for the next one.

Did the company eventually fulfill its promise? I don't know, but one conclusion is clear: poor employee performance isn't always due to laziness. Most often, internal factors are involved.

In the first case, the problem was a crisis that demanded empathy. In the second, it was lost motivation that could have been restored.

Conclusion: A good leader recognizes that discipline without empathy breaks the team, and empathy without discipline makes it ineffective. It is precisely the balance between these two forces that determines how well a team functions.
