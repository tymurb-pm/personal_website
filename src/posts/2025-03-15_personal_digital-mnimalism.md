# One day I realized I was spending hours scrolling through information I neither needed nor wanted.  

That's weird, isn't it? How could something designed to give us information end up flooding us with noise?  

We all know that the modern internet runs on algorithms. Algorithms are great at figuring out what captures our attention, but terrible at knowing what actually matters to us. They measure success in minutes spent online, not the quality of the minutes spent. This creates an anomaly: we're more informed than ever, yet less focused and productive.  

So I started wondering, is there a simpler way to manage information? Could I still be informed without constantly drowning in a sea of algorithmic noise?  

My first experiment was radical simplicity. I limited my social media accounts to three: **Telegram, YouTube, and LinkedIn** — LinkedIn purely out of professional necessity, Telegram for friends, and YouTube only when I deliberately seek something. No Facebook, no Instagram, no Twitter. Initially, it felt strange, like I'd miss something crucial. But after a few months, I noticed the opposite: **I missed nothing**. Important news still found its way to me through conversations.  

The next anomaly came with news consumption. Why did I feel anxious or angry after checking the news? Because modern media has evolved to **grab attention rather than inform objectively**. To counteract this, I shrunk my news sources to just a handful of Telegram channels—carefully chosen small, independent outlets, preferably supported by direct donations. Such channels have only one incentive: **serve the reader**. If their quality slips, I simply unsubscribe without hesitation.  

For essential communication, I moved important discussions away from messengers and into **email**, using a simple and cheap service like **PurelyMail**. Paying a small fee each year gives me a neat trade-off: fewer distractions, more clarity and ownerhip of my mail.  

But perhaps the biggest anomaly was discovering that the simplest and most powerful solution had already existed for decades: **RSS feeds**. Most people have forgotten about them, but RSS lets you subscribe directly to blogs and authors you trust. **No algorithm, no distraction — just a pure, chronological stream of ideas.**  

I'm nostalgic for the early days of the web when personal blogs flourished. Authors like **Paul Graham** or **Johanna Rothman** still maintain sites where their essays feel personal, thoughtful, and genuine — something social media rarely provides. I wish there were more of these small, thoughtful islands of content, written carefully and read intentionally.  

What I learned from these experiments is simple yet powerful: **complexity and overload aren't inevitable**. The internet doesn't have to be a battleground for our attention. By consciously limiting where I place my focus, I've regained **clarity, productivity, and most importantly, space to think**.  

Maybe you don't need radical digital minimalism. But if you feel overwhelmed, remember that **simplicity isn't just possible—it's surprisingly liberating**.
